Laravel and Vue JS project 

 I have used Laravel for the backend API and Vue JS for the frontend. 
 Regarding the Backend, I have done migrations, seeders, interfaces, controllers, models, routes, 
 services, and validations. Everything has been tested with CURL requests. 
 As for the Frontend - I have created a Navbar with 3 separate pages and routes for the 
 Vue.js environment. Additional integrations in main.js, App.js, route.js. I have used Axios. 
 The time I have spent includes sketches and drafting a work plan, installing both projects separately, 
 configuring them, connecting the database, and building the code, which took 2 works days.
